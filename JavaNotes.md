## Introduction To Java
- Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. The intention of using this language is to give relief to the developers from writing codes for every platform. The term WORA, write once and run everywhere is often associated with this language. It means whenever we compile a Java code, we get the byte code (.class file), and that can be executed (without compiling it again) on different platforms provided they support Java. In the year 1995, Java language was developed. It is mainly used to develop web, desktop, and mobile devices. The Java language is known for its robustness, security, and simplicity features. That is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
## History
- The Java language has a very interesting history. Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and Jame Gosling, known as the Green team, started the development of Java in the year 1991. These people were the engineers at Sun Microsystems. In 1996, the first public implementation was released as Java 1.0. The compiler of Java 1.0 was rewritten by Arthur Van Hoff. With the introduction of Java 2, the new versions have multiple different configurations that have been built for the various platforms. It is worth noting that James Gosling is also known as the father of Java.
## JDK
- Java Development Kit (JDK): It is the complete Java Development Kit that encompasses everything, including JRE(Java Runtime Environment), compiler, java docs, debuggers, etc. JDK must be installed on the computer for the creation, compilation, and execution of a Java program.
## JRE
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JRE is part of the JDK. If a system has only JRE installed, then the user can only run the program. In other words, only the java command works. The compilation of a Java program will not be possible (the javac command will not work).
## JVM
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine):the JVM is like the engine that makes your house work. It's a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode, which is the compiled form of your Java code. The JVM takes care of translating this bytecode into instructions that your computer's operating system can understand and execute. So, whenever you run a Java program, it's the JVM that actually executes the code.



program = set of instruction that can be provided by the user to the computer
