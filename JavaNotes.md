## JDK
- JDK (Java Development Kit): Imagine you're building a house. The JDK is like your toolbox. It contains all the tools (like a hammer, nails, saw, etc.) you need to build your house. Similarly, the JDK provides all the tools and utilities needed for developing Java applications. This includes the compiler to turn your code into a format that computers understand, as well as other tools to help you debug and manage your code.
## JRE
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Now, imagine your built house is ready to live in. The JRE is like the finished house itself. It includes everything needed to run Java applications on your computer. So, if you have a Java program that's already been built, you need the JRE installed on your computer to be able to run it. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and other libraries that are necessary to execute Java programs.
## JVM
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Going back to our house analogy, the JVM is like the engine that makes your house work. It's a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode, which is the compiled form of your Java code. The JVM takes care of translating this bytecode into instructions that your computer's operating system can understand and execute. So, whenever you run a Java program, it's the JVM that actually executes the code.



program = set of instruction that can be provided by the user to the computer
